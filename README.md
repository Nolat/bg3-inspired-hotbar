# BG3 Inspired HUD

A Foundry VTT module that reimagines the hotbar interface with a design inspired by Baldur's Gate 3. It provides a persistent, token-specific interface for managing abilities, spells, and effects with modern UI/UX principles.

**Please check the Settings menu in Foundry VTT for options such as auto-populating actions for unlinked tokens, opacity adjustments, and fade out settings.**

Coffee helps me stay up to 2am to write these modules. Thank you for the lack of sleep in advance!

## Troubleshooting: Unlinked tokens that were previously linked

If an unlinked token is missing actions or shows mismatched entries (e.g., common actions in the Combat container pointing to the base actor instead of the token), follow these steps to fully reset the token’s hotbar data:

1. Re-enable “Link Actor Data” for the actor’s base prototype token.
2. Drag a linked token for this actor onto the canvas.
3. Completely clear the BG3 hotbar for that token (all hotbar containers, Weapons, Combat/Common Actions) and ensure Passive and Active effects panels show nothing.
4. Delete the placed token.
5. Open the actor’s prototype token again and uncheck “Link Actor Data” to make tokens unlinked.
6. Place a new unlinked token onto the canvas. The module will auto-populate it cleanly.
